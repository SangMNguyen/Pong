Game Description:
My own version of the popular game Pong. Pong is a two player game with each player controlling a paddle-like entity and a ball-type projectile flying around the game area, bouncing off of the top and bottom boundaries of the game areas. The goal of the game is for a player to have the projectile pass the other player's paddle, hitting the opposite horizontal boundary of the game area.

Current Goals:
- Understand components and their attributes
- Learn about collision and consistently updating the game
- Work out controls

Long-term Goals:
- Having a working remake of Pong
- Allow for keyboard or mouse as the controls
- Include a 2-Player Mode and a Singleplayer Mode against an AI with modifiable difficulty
- Include a new mechanic where the player can hold the ball
